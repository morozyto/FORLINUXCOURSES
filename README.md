# FORLINUXCOURSES

It was the try to do the course final project: running the script and going to the localhost in browser, the user had to see the current and updated statistics of the system in the HTML table. A bundle of Apache + nginx is used. The project is not completed, because I did not have enough time then. It remains only to code the gather of information about the system, its parsing and output in a readable form.
